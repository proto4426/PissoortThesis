# Where can you find the DATA ? 

The project's data used for this thesis are confidential and have been distributed by the Institut Royal de Météorologie from Uccle. Hence, I cannot put it as public and you must ask me if you would like to handle the data. 

The `data` folder only contains the yearly data for use into the Shiny application.
