# First visualisation : Shiny

After having loaded the package in your environement, you can run

`# Be sure to have grid, gridExtra, plotly and ggplot2 already installed`

`runExample('trend_modes')  # Present the yearly analysis visualizaiton for Block-Maxima (...)`
`runExample('splines_draws')  # Present the simulation study of the GAM model with splines (...)`


# Where can you find the DATA ? 

The project's data used for this thesis are confidential and have been distributed by the Institut Royal de Météorologie from Uccle. Hence, I cannot put it as public and you must ask me if you would like to handle the data. 

The `data` folder only contains the yearly data for use into the Shiny application.
