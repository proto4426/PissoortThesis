* **Burn-in M** number of deleted values is small, meaning that starting values are not very influent.
* **Total N**  is the advised number of iterations, which is actually quite close to our "choice" (=2000) 
* **Lower bound Nmin** is the minimum sample size based on zero autocorrelation. Here it is relatively low, so it is a good point.
* **Dependence factor I** informs about the dependence into the chains, or the extent to which autocorrelation inflates the required sample size. It is common to say that values above 5for this criterion indicate a strong autocorrelation. Here we see that it is slightly the case, especially for $\xi$.
