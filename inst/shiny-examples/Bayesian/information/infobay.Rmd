## R code 

* The application is hosted at the following [URL](https://github.com/proto4426/PissoortThesis/) **(to update !)**. 
* The **global repository** for the thesis which contains the R package can be found [here](https://github.com/proto4426/PissoortThesis/)
* The **specific code**  for this app can be found in this [folder](https://github.com/proto4426/PissoortThesis/tree/master/inst/shiny-examples).

The following package are needed to run the application : 

```{r pack, eval=F}
install.packages(c("shiny", "htmltools", "shinythemes","tidyverse","DT",
                   "gridExtra","grid","mvtnorm","plotly","HDInterval","ggjoy","scales","heatmaply", "coda"))
## And of course the package for this thesis ... 
devtools::install_github("proto4426/PissoortThesis", build_vignettes=T)
```

## Model 

* The number of starting values (see diagnostics) influence the total number of iterations ! 
* The seed is set for both the random generation of the starting values (see Algorithm 1 in the text) and the random generation of all the Markov chains. All results can thus be easily retrieved, without having to set two different seeds. 

## Prior

* Yet, these priors are taken to be univariate Normal distributions for each parameters. It would be interesting to incorporate other forms of priors as discussed in 
* The values set by default here and in the thesis are chosen... by default ! **But**, since these are taken to be uninformative (near-flat) priors, relatively small changes won't change the ouput. Verify it by your mouse !
